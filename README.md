<h2>Maze part description</h2>

<h3>


Application run arguments:</h3>
argv[1] - file containing prepared maze
argv[2] - solving method
argv[3] - file for save results <optional>
argv[4] - draw the solving <optional>
<br />

<h3>Maze file structure:
</h3>
First line contains (separate number using spaces) in order maze width, maze height, begin point coords, end point coords
next <height> lines contains <width> values 0 or 1, where: 0 - free space, 1 - wall
e.g.
5 5 0 1 4 1
1 1 1 1 1
0 0 1 0 0
1 0 0 0 1
1 0 0 0 1
1 1 1 1 1
<br/>
Restrictions:
- begin and end points must be different
- both width and height must be greater than 1

<br/>

<h3>Available solving methods:</h3>
1  -  random way
2  -  breadth first search
3  -  dreadth first search
4  -  dijkstra algorithm
5  -  A*
6  -  Bidirectional search (double A*)
<br/>
All maze run statistics are saving in 'result.csv' file which is compatibile with regular *.csv format.
First line contains category names. Each row contains one result separeted by semi-colon.

<h2>Maze generator part description</h2>
